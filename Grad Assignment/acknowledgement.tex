Embarking on this journey into the fascinating field of Continual Learning and Glitch Detection would not have been possible without the support of many incredible people. \\

First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Dr. Stefano Bromuri and Dr. Daniel Tan as well as Tom Dooney. Your guidance and insightful discussions, and unwavering patience throughout this process were invaluable. \\

My heartfelt thanks go to the entire faculty and staff at Howest (Howest University of Applied Sciences). My homebase and supportive environment. A special shout-out to the Applied Computer Science education program for their tireless efforts to aid me wherever they could, especially the program coordinator, William Schokkelé, Director of Education, Isabel Uitdebroeck and my dear colleague Dr. Ines Devlieger for her critical eye on proofreading the results section. \\

To my amazing husband, Cédric, my unwavering rock throughout this endeavor, thank you for your belief in me. Your understanding during late nights and weekends spent buried in research has been a source of immense strenght. I would not be here without your support and love.\\

Who would have thought that at the age of 41 I would finally succeed in achieving one of my long aspired goals of achieving a Master of Science degree, a journey that started over three years ago with a Postgraduate has finally come to an end. An open ending because life starts at 41 right...\\
