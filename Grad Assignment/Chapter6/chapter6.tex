\section{Recommendations}
The research done as described in \ref{sec-Research} and \ref{chap:models_and_results} is promising about the potential of investigating multi-modal fusion architectures for \acrshort{gw} analysis, the combination of Spectrogram Image Analysis combined with Fractal Dimensions of Auxiliary Channels gave outstanding results \ref{subsub:rq3}. \\
Further research, especially the integration of attention \citep{vaswani2017attention, niu2021review} should be investigated on additional fractal dimension data, preferably with more than 3 glitch categories.
